Bio: I'm a full-time quantitative trader who has been working on data analytics since before it was cool.  Prior to becoming a full-time quant, I built products and managed teams at software companies across Silicon Valley.  I've had a long-standing interest in finance (earned my CFA designation in 2008) and have dedicated myself to the challenge of applying data science to financial markets.
