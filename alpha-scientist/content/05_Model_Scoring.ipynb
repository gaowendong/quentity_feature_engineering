    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of machine learning in the quantitative investment field is, by all indications, skyrocketing.  The proliferation of easily accessible data - both traditional and alternative - along with some very approachable frameworks for machine learning models - is encouraging many to explore the arena.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these financial ML explorers are learning that there are many ways in which using ML to predict financial time series differs greatly from labeling cat pictures or flagging spam.  Among these differences is that traditional model performance metrics (RSQ, MSE, accuracy, F1, etc...) can be misleading and incomplete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past several years, I've developed a set of metrics which have proved useful for comparing and optimizing financial time series models.  These metrics attempt to measure models' _predictive power_ but also their _trade-ability_, critically important for those who actually intend to _use_ their models in the real world.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I will present a general outline of my approach and will demonstrate a few of the most useful metrics I've added to my standard \"scorecard\".  I look forward to hearing how others may think to extend the concept.
