    "### About this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first in a six-part series on the mechanics of applying machine learning techniques to the unique domain of stock market price prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use of machine learning in the quantitative investment field is, by all indications, skyrocketing.  The proliferation of easily accessible data - both traditional and alternative - along with some very approachable frameworks for machine learning models - is encouraging many to explore the arena.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, usage of machine learning in stock market prediction requires much more than a good grasp of the concepts and techniques for supervised machine learning.  As I describe further in [this post], stock prediction is a challenging domain which requires some special techniques to overcome issues like non-stationarity, collinearity, and low signal-to-noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this and following posts, I'll present the design of an end-to-end system for developing, testing, and applying machine learning models in a way which addresses each of these problems in a very practical way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials _are not intended_ offer any \"secret sauce\" or strategies which I use in live trading, but will offer a more valuable and more generalized set of techniques which will allow you to create your own strategies in a robust manner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Secret_Sauce.jpg\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Within other posts in this series, I plan to cover:\n",
    "* Part 2: [Feature engineering](feature_engineering.html)\n",
    "* Part 3: [Feature selection](feature_selection.html)\n",
    "* Part 4: [Walk-forward modeling](walk_forward_model_building.html)\n",
    "* Part 5: [Evaluating model performance](model_evaluation)\n",
    "* Part 6: Building ensemble models to combine many models and factors into an overall prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In future, I also plan to make tutorials on:\n",
    "* Using Pandas, scikit-learn, and pandas plus scikit-learn\n",
    "* Techniques for improving model predictive power\n",
    "* Techniques for improving model robustness out-of-sample\n",
    "... and probably others (please feel free to suggest in below comments) \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, I will assume readers have a good working knowledge of python and `pandas` as well as basic supervised machine learning concepts.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### About this post\n",
    "In this first post, I will present a framework for organizing and working with data.  Perhaps not the most electrifying of topics, but it's a precondition for comprehending later modeling tutorials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also, as any practitioner of the field will agree, of critical significance and importance.  I've heard it said that 90% of time in real-world quant finance is spent on data rather than models.  That may be a bit of an exagggeration, but not far off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following a coherent data management schema (mine or otherwise) will save countless hours of frustration and will allow you to scale your projects to teams of contributors"

    "### Types of Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "My system for handling data makes heavy use of three main types of data collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __`features`:__ This is a dataframe which contains all _features_ or values which we will allow models to use in the course of learning relationships - and later making predictions.  All features must be values which would have been known __at the point in time when the model needed to make predictions__.  \n",
    "\n",
    " In other words, `next_12_months_returns` would be a bad feature since it would not become known at the time needed.  The `features` dataframe has a multi-index of date/symbol and column names unique to each feature.  More on this later. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* __`outcomes`:__ This is a dataframe of all possible __future__ outcomes which we may be interested in predicting, magically shifted back in time to T-zero.  For instance, we may want to predict the total_return for a symbol over the year following T=0 (the time of prediction).  We would look ahead into the future, calculate what ultimately did happen to this metric, and log it onto time T=0.  I'll explain why in a minute.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Just like `features`, this dataframe has rows indexed by date/symbol and columns named with a convention which describes the feature.  \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* __`master`:__ The final data structure type is the `master` dataframe.  This contains any _static_ information about each symbol in the universe, such as the SIC code, the number of shares outstanding, beta factors, etc...  \n",
    "\n",
    "  In practice, things in the master may change over time (SIC codes and shares out can both change...) but I've found it sufficient for my purposes to take the current static values for the current point in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  This dataframe uses row index of symbol only.  You could, of course, add a date/symbol index if you wanted to reflect changing values over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this data scheme?\n",
    "It may seem odd to split the features and outcomes into distinct dataframes, and odd to create a dataframe of several different possible \"outcomes\".  Most important, it may seem odd to record on t=0 what will happen in the _next_ day, week, month, etc...  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons for this approach:\n",
    "1. This makes it trivial to extract the X's and y's when training models.  Just slice some columns from `features` for the X and slice one column of `outcomes` in y.  They're already aligned and ready for fitting.  \n",
    "2. This makes it trivial to toggle between various time horizons - just change the column of `outcomes` used for y.\n",
    "3. This helps us guard against inadvertent \"peeking\" at the future.  We only ever use `features` columns in X.  \n",
    "4. This allows us to use the incredibly efficient pandas `join`, `merge`, and `concat` methods to quickly align data for purposes of training models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Trust me.  This will save you many, many hours of debugging and brute force coding down the road.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## An example\n",
    "Let's create simple toy examples of each dataframe using free data from [quandl](https://www.quandl.com/): \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll make a utility function which downloads one or more symbols from quandl and returns the adjusted OHLC data (I generally find adjusted data to be best)."
