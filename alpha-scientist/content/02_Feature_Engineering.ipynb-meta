Bio: I'm a full-time quantitative trader who has been working on data analytics since before it was cool.  Prior to becoming a full-time quant, I built products and managed teams at software companies across Silicon Valley.  I've had a long-standing interest in finance (earned my CFA designation in 2008) and have dedicated myself to the challenge of applying data science to financial markets.
Summary: This post is going to delve into the mechanics of feature engineering for the sorts of time series data that you may use as part of a stock price prediction modeling system. I'll cover the basic concept, then offer some useful python code "recipes" for transforming your raw source data into features which can be fed directly into a ML algorithm or ML pipeline.
