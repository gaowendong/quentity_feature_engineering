# alpha-scientist

This repo is mainly a back-end for the blog [alphascientist.com](https://alphascientist.com), which is hosted on Github Pages.  

The purpose of the blog is to share research and lessons learned from applying machine learning and data science methods to financial markets.  Postings will be a mix of "how-to" posts and noteworthy findings on market inefficiencies.  

Guest writers and other contributors are welcomed.  Please create an issue/pull request or contact me at thealphascientist at gmail dotcom if you've got interest in contributing.


## Platform
This blog is generated with [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) using a modified version of the [octopress theme](https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme), and of course hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).  All work very nicely together.
